## Requirements

- [] There will be a toolbar on the left of the screen and the objects here will be added to the canvas when clicked.
- [] Objects in Canvas can be moved by dragging and dropping.
- [] I should be able to delete the objects I added from the canvas.
- [] I should be able to rotate the objects I add around their own axis.
